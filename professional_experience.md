## Professional Experience

### Tier 2 Tech

**HostRocket, Inc. & DotBlock**  
*Clifton Park, NY*

- Tier 1 Tech, *(May 2014 - Sept 2016)*
- Tier 2 Tech, *(Sept 2016 - present)* 

#### Responsibilities

* Troubleshooting technical issues for webhosting customers

#### Accomplishments

* Rewrote a majority of the companyâ€™s existing customer-facing documentation, adding additional articles as necessary, in effort to improve the availability and speed of solutions for common issues for customers. This improved customers' ability to self-diagnose common issues not requiring direct intervention from techs, and reduced the volume of support time spent on customer requests for out of scope assistance.
* Researched and planned migration of internal documentation to a more flexible software; removed or updated outdated content; and composed a large volume of articles containing information which had previously been undocumented.
* Restructured ticket system departments and support procedures to standardize and streamline policies, contributing to reduced ticket volume and response time, as well as helping techs more easily determine effective solutions.
* Revised the training procedure to improve the speed and accuracy of onboarding new techs.
