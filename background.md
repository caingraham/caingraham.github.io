## Education & Background

I originally went to school for literature and philosophy, but life circumstances eventually lead me to a job in webhosting, where I learned Linux server administration. As it turns out, due to the experiences with logic and systems thinking concepts, philosophy is an incredible background to have going into computer science. It's a beautiful interdisciplinary niche that resides right at the crossroads of mathmatics, aesthetics, cognitive psychology, and a number of other facinating fields.

What I learned from these last few years is that the act of learning itself is a skill that can be developed, and I no longer have any doubt that I can teach myself any new concept so long as I can find the right approach. While traditional school was a valuable experience, I've found much more success integrating daily learning into my lifestyle and consider myself a lifelong, constant student.

I use services like Brilliant, DataQuest, and SkillShare to develop my skillset, along with keeping a healthy dose of 'edutainment' YouTube channels in my subscription list, operating under the 'Garbage In, Garbage Out' concept.

Because of this background, I'm passionate about the open source / open access movement and I contribute to a number of educational content creators through Patreon. I've been active on Citizen Science / Citizen History projects on the [Zooniverse.org](https://www.zooniverse.org/) platform, such as [this project](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/usct/african-american-civil-war-soldiers) to help transcribe military records of African American soldiers in the American Civil War.
