## About Me

[About Me]

### Fun Facts

- I have sequence-space [synesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia), and experience a spatial sensation of the months of the year as a ring in the space around me, sort of like [this](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/discoblog/files/2010/04/synaesthesia.jpg). This means that if I were asked to list the months backwards, rather than reciting a memorized list of words, I'd rely on 'seeing' the series of months rotating around me and say them in the order they appear.
