## About Me

I'm a philosopher, technologist, and polymath.

I like to think I straddle that fine line between creative and technical. I enjoy speculating about future tech. If decide I need to know a skill in order to do something right, then I teach myself that skill. I’m a big fan of the 5-hour rule (if you’re not spending 5+ hours a week learning something new, you’re being irresponsible).

I would fit best in a role that would benefit from a creative, multidisciplinary perspective, and where I can channel my talent into meaningful contributions toward a .

Currently, I’m fascinated by systems theory and complex systems design. In my free time, I gamemaster a Dungeons and Dragons campaign and play in several others, and I’m teaching myself data science and machine learning concepts.

### Fun Facts

- I have sequence-space [synesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia), and experience a spatial sensation of the months of the year as a ring in the space around me, sort of like [this](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/discoblog/files/2010/04/synaesthesia.jpg). This means that if I were asked to list the months backwards, rather than reciting a memorized list of words, I'd rely on 'seeing' the series of months rotating around me and say them in the order they appear.
